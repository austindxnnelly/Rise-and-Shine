USAGE:
Run this app on an android device running Android 11 or above, API level 30. Anything lower and the alarms will not come through at the desired time.
The initial screen shows the set alarms or is empty if no alarms have been set. To set an alarm click the '+' button and it will allow you to set an alarm.
When the alarm goes off it will notify the user and *soon* will require puzzles to dismiss the alarm.

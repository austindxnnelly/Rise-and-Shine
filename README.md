Build:
Use android studio to build this app. 
https://developer.android.com/studio/run

USAGE:
Run this app on an android device running Android 11 or above, API level 30. Anything lower and the alarms will not come through at the desired time.
The initial screen shows the set alarms or is empty if no alarms have been set. To set an alarm click the '+' button and it will allow you to set an alarm.
When the alarm goes off it will notify the user and *soon* will require puzzles to dismiss the alarm. Swipe left to delete the alarm. Or hold down
the alarm row in order to open the alarm editor (Editing yet to be implemented). If an alarm's switch is flipped and you open the editor it will
display a countdown when the alarm will go off.

Emulator:
This app has been tested on an emulated Pixel 5 API 31 System Image S
